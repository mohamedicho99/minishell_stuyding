 what do i know so far about parsing? 

parsing has tree stages! 

1. tokanizing
	1.1 handle quotes (single & double)

2. grammar
	1.1 operators
	1.2 pipes
	
3. building the command! 

________

let's get obssesed with this one! 

but how can i do that? 

obsessed here might mean:

first,
	know the subject inside and out, cause we are doing the bonus, 
		so, i need to be on the look out for that! 

2nd,
	break the thing down into problems and learn from different people how 
		did they solve different problems! 

	(there are some very unique and simple but powerfull solutions out there,
		like how S.a.a.d used the a char variable to populate with either
		single or double quotes and called that process activating either 
		single or double quote, so he knows how his program should act!)

______________

(grammar rules are extracted regarding the positioning and syntax of the tokens)
(every token has it's own rules if you look deeply into it!
going no food for the next days to see it more clearly.)
rules:
	pipe token should be between two words or
		WORD_TOKEN PIPE_TOKEN WORD_TOKEN/RED_TOKEN
	for every new token, we run the rules check! 
		based on what the token is
	create two tokens for \ (backslash) and ; (semi_colon)
		if any detected, give syntax error

_____________________

number one priority: 

practice making tokens out of a command first! 

do this for about two hours or so! 

firt do it without quotes at first.

try to think about dynamic string and how could you implement them in here!

right now, i should be coding, i don't know exaactly what's keeping from doing
	the work that needs to be done! 

i think all i need is some pushups
